## DataAutomation_SimComNets

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, shell scripts, CSV files, and C++ code developed during university coursework and self-study. The focus is on learning and applying data automation, analysis, and visualization techniques using real-world scenarios, such as cleaning and enriching datasets, building reports, and performing statistical computations.

Each exercise (Ex02 through Final-Task) builds practical skills using Python’s data ecosystem and demonstrates key steps of the data pipeline from ingestion to visualization.
